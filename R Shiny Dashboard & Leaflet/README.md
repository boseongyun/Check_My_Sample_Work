The pictures show the snapshots of my Rshiny Dashboard & Leaflet.

I am currently unable to reproduce all of the work due to RAM limit (given to free acounts).
I would have to pay extra money to increase my ram limit. However, you can reproduce my on your local machine!

* app.r: the minimial version of my work
* saved.r: the full version of my work

**Notes: Please download another R Shiny Dashboard & Leaflet folder that contains the data in order to run**
