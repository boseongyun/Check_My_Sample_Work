#### Hello, welcome to my website. I have uploaded a list of my sample work to provide you a ballpark meaasure of my capabilities in programming, modeling and analyzing. Although not uploaded in this list due to confidentiality concerns, I have extensively dealth with spatial data where I performed area-weighted spatial aggregation using netCDF file. Please reach out to me if you would like to see some sample work. Otherwise, Enjoy!
